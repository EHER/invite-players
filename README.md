# Invite Players
A collection of tools to wire up games and notification systems in order to get players together.

## [Terraria](terraria)
To connect your [Terraria](https://www.terraria.org/) Server running on 
[Nodecraft](https://nodecraft.com) to [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nl/).

It was tested with Terraria but other games with support to webhook 
may work as well.

## [Truck Simulator](truck-simulator)
If you like to play [Euro Truck Simulator II](https://eurotrucksimulator2.com/)
or [American Truck Simulator](https://americantrucksimulator.com/) on
classic single player but also enjoy to share same experience with other 
players. 

It requires you to login on [World of Trucks](https://www.worldoftrucks.com) 
and to deliver online jobs.
