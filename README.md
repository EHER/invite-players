# invite-players
A collection of tools to wire up games and notification systems in order to get players together.

## [Terraria](terraria)
To connect your [Terraria](https://www.terraria.org/) Server running on 
[Nodecraft](https://nodecraft.com) with notification systems like Slack.

It was tested with Terraria but other games with support to webhook 
may work as well.

## [Truck Simulator](truck-simulator)
If you like to play Euro Truck Simulator II or American Truck Simulator on
classic single player but also enjoy to share same experience with other 
players. You must use your [World of Trucks](https://www.worldoftrucks.com) 
account and deliver online jobs.
